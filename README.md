# js-2048

A web-based implementation of the classic 2048 game, showcasing my front-end development skills with a strong emphasis on JavaScript for logic and DOM manipulation, paired with structured HTML and SCSS for styling. This project highlights my ability to create interactive, responsive applications with clean code and modern layout techniques.

## Key Features

  - **Game Logic**: Fully functional 2048 game built with JavaScript, including tile merging and win/lose conditions.  
  - **DOM Interaction**: Dynamic updates to the game board via JavaScript DOM manipulation for a seamless user experience.  
  - **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout optimized for all devices, styled with SCSS and CSS Grid/Flexbox.  
  - **SCSS Styling**: Modular and maintainable styles using SCSS features like variables, nesting, and mixins.  

## Technologies Used

  - **HTML5**: Semantic markup providing the foundation for the game structure.  
  - **SCSS**: Preprocessed CSS for responsive and visually appealing styling, compiled to CSS3.  
  - **JavaScript**: Core game logic, event handling, and real-time DOM manipulation.
